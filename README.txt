This project is based on Natural Language processing. 
The given dataset contains movie reviews and whether they are positive or negaive reviews.
Since it is a huge dataset, it needs to be cleaned. So first all the unnecessary words are removed from the review.
Then a bag of word model is created. Last step is to implement any classification algorithm. here I have implemented Naive 
bayes classification .
